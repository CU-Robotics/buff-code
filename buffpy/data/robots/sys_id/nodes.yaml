#     Kinematic Transforms
#
#   These transforms are used to convert a control input into motor references [[angle; speed]: n],
# or sensor feedback into a state estimate [x,y,theta,phi,psi,gamma] (inverse, forward).
# Motor controls are a linear combo of the state and reference: U = Nr - Kx
# reference comes from a control input (user/hybrid/auto)
# states come from the various onboard sensors & estimators.

#   Inverse
#  least squares kinematic gains

#     Motor Controllers
#
#   Information to control the operation of 
# on board motors. The goal of these vectors
# is to track the motor references faster than
# they can update.

#    Motor Controlelr Types
#   Motor controllers will set their third feedback term to either a system power value or a
# gravitational offset. The idea is we can efficiently conrol and reconfig a system invovling
# power sensitive actuation and inverse pendulum like linkages.
# 0 = power, 1 = pendulum (more coming soon...)
motor_controller_types:
  - [1]


#    Motor Controller Gains
#   Motor gains are multiplied by the motor feedback to produce a control signal. The control law
# this imposes on the system is 
#     ui = K[i] * ([ref_angle; ref_speed; 0] - [angle_fb; speed_fb; Fpow/pend])
#
# where K[i] is the ith row (1x3) and '*' is a vector inner product ((1x3)(3x1)).
#         Kp,         Kd,   (Kpow/Kpend) # Motor the output is routed to
motor_gains: 
  - [0.0000, 0.00, 0.000000] # motor 0

#    Motor output Limits
#   All our actuators are continous DC motors. All of the outputs are in terms of radians.
# We can set limits on the output by limiting our input. The reference for the ith motor's 
# controller is bounded by row i. This is not sufficient to gaurantee the motor will not 
# leave these boundaries. IFF The closed loop system is stable => bounded(r) -> bounded(y).
# Set the low boundary greater or equal to the high boundary to disable the limit check.
#   [ low roll over limit, high roll over limit, low angle, high angle]
