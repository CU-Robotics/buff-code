#! /usr/bin/env python3
"""
	Project: Odyssey Launch Platform
	Author: Mitchell D Scott
	Description:
	  This is a python3 command line tool from CU Robotics.
	Use this script to spawn systems. Systems are defined as
	yaml files in buffpy/config/lib. A system consists of a 
	setof ROS nodes and the topics that link them. A system may
	also include data files (yaml) to configure nodes. Nodes
	do not accept arguments, everything needs to be passed 
	through the ROS-param server.

	  The goal is to eliminate the overhead of using launch files.
	This script is also designed to make the migration to ROS2 and
	python3 as easy as possible (hope this happens soon). Another
	benefit of this method is the ability to deploy the same source
	to a variety of robots. All robots launch code the same way but
	by importing different system yamls or data yamls the overall
	systems can vary dramatically.

	TODO:
	  - Wait until the migration for major developments
	  - Don't loop after starting processes, just wait for 
	  	them to finish.

	NOTES:
		It's been awhile, I'll get back to you
