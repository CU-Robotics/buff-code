	A Packet struct to clean up the inserts and reads.
	The goal is to have an hid.fill_report_xxx(data),
	that will put the data in our HID report structure and
	send it to serial. Similarly hid.read() should decompose
	the recieved report into smaller data.
	
	the main priority is putting data in and out of the packet.
	There is some discussion to be had on whose job it is to
	determine indexing, for now it will be the developers responsibility.

	Get/Set requirements:
		IMU:  			float[9]
		
		DR16: 			byte[18]

		CAN:  			int16[i][3] (feedback)
			  			int16[i]    (command)

		Teensy clock:	int32

	HID_REPORT also has quick functions to
	read and write its data.
