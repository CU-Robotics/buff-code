/*
* This example reads an SBUS packet from an SBUS receiver and writes it to an
* SBUS compatible servo. The SBUS out capability (i.e. writing a command to
* the servo) could be generated independently; however, the packet timing
* would need to be controlled by the programmer, the write function simply
* generates an SBUS packet and writes it to the servos. In this case the
* packet timing is handled by the SBUS receiver and waiting for a good packet
* read.
